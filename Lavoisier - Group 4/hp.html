		<p>Noli me Tangere is an 1887 novel
		by Jos√© Rizal during the colonization <br/>
		of the Philippines by the Spanish 
		Empire, to describe perceived <br/>
		inequities of the Spanish Catholic
		friars and the ruling government.<br/>
		</p><br/>
		<p>Originally written in Spanish, the book 
		is more commonly published and read in <br/>
		the Philippines in either Tagalog or English.
		Together with its sequel, El filibusterismo<br/>
		(Grade 10), the reading of Noli is obligatory 
		for high school students (Grade 9) throughout<br/>
		the country. The two novels are widely 
		considered the national epic of the<br/>
		Philippines and are adapted in many forms,
		such as operas, musicals, plays, and other
		forms of art.
